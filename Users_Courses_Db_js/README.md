# Express
In this project I used `Express` to create an Api that handles requests and responses

## Input Validation
With the help of `joi` library in node.js the Api was able validate users input before handling 
reuests.


### Group Route
Since I was dealing with differents routes, it became necessary to group each routes. 
I achieved this with the `.Router` in Express
